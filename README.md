# spinny
Procedurally generated animation of the anti-twister mechanism and its connection to Spin(3).
Also known as Dirac's belt trick, a demonstration of an object that is subject to $4\pi$ or $720°$ symmetry, so it has to be rotated twice to revert to its initial state.

Inspired by Jason Hise's animations, please check out:
